## TODO
- Pass custom session name feature in sessionManager
  - The import for mongo schemas should have some relation to it in import path??
  - The rename session feature should be in sessionManager base class
- starred should not be in session schema it should be in custom session schema
- Trace id needs to be passed in response header
- allow provider name and mdoel to be provided from client side
- tracing for individual provider such as mongodb has to be configured in backend and not in package
